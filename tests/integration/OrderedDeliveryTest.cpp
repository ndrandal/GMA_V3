// ENC-1005 — SPEC specs/2026-09-20-gma-join-correctness D3, D4.
// "Delivery is serialized per request DAG."
//
// `tests/treebuilder/CorpusTest.cpp`'s `Corpus86_SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents` is
// the PRODUCT gate for this: it says the bid-ask spread of a real corpus entry
// comes out at 0.02 under concurrency. It is a value assertion, so it can only
// tell you that *something* about the join went wrong. These tests pin the
// MECHANISM underneath it, one property per test, so a future regression names
// itself:
//
//   1. `rt::Strand` really is a strand — FIFO, and never two tasks at once.
//   2. One DAG's delivery is in production order, end to end, at 8 threads.
//   3. The two sides of one tick reach the join in the order the Dispatcher
//      produced them — the half that the strand alone does NOT buy, because
//      that ordering is decided one hop UPSTREAM of it.
//   4. The strand is per REQUEST, not per process: four DAGs still occupy four
//      cores. This is the structural claim SPEC §5 Q2's ruling rests on, and
//      it is the difference between "serialize a DAG" and "serialize the
//      engine".
//
// Every one of these was mutation-tested: the defect each names was introduced
// into the engine and each test was confirmed to go red, and the others to stay
// green. The mutations and their results are in the ENC-1005 ticket.
//
// NOTHING IS STUBBED. Each test builds through the real `tree::buildForRequest`
// from a real request object and drives values through the real
// `Dispatcher::onTick`. The only substitution is the terminal, the parameter
// `buildForRequest` already takes.

// `INode::deliversOnOwnExecutor`), and the assertion below is the gate on that.

// so this test states its own premise: `Aggregate(2)` over `ask` and `bid` of
// one symbol forwards a completed batch member by member
// (`Aggregate::onPortValue` forwards a completed tuple member by member), so

// four strands — and each one's terminal parks until all four have arrived.

// spins on the shared counter until it reaches four or the deadline passes, so
// the pass is proof of real overlap and the failure is bounded.

// this test asserted a single shared flag, and it SURVIVED ITS OWN MUTATION:
// with all four DAGs forced onto one strand the first terminal parked to the
// deadline and the other three then ran one after another, and the FOURTH
// still observed a count of four — trivially, because it was itself the
// fourth — and set the flag. It reported "they overlapped" about a run that was
