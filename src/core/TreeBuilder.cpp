// ---------- ENC-1293: Record-valued terminal rejection ----------
//
// SPEC specs/2026-09-20-gma-join-correctness D7.
//
// **THIS RESTRICTION IS DELIBERATELY TEMPORARY. ENC-1295 (embassy) lifts it.**
// Delete this whole block, its call site in `buildForRequest`, and
// `tests/treebuilder/RecordTerminalTest.cpp` once embassy consumes a
// Record-valued update instead of dropping it.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. `Pack` emits a `gma::Record`; `util::writeArgTypeJson`
// (include/gma/util/JsonUtil.hpp) serializes a Record as a JSON **object** onto
// the live update frame (`src/server/ClientSession.cpp`'s `sendFn`). embassy's
// inbound path is scalar-only: `asFloat32` (embassy/internal/gma/types.go)
// decodes `number | string | boolean` and returns false for an object, and its
// caller in `internal/gma/client.go` does `if !ok { return }` — **no log, no
// metric, no error**, and the whole downstream contract is
// `ValueHandler func(value float32)`. So a `Pack`-terminated pipeline renders
// an empty chart with no diagnostic anywhere **in two repos**. Rejecting at
// build time converts that silent cross-repo failure into a loud single-repo
// one, on a frame the client already understands.
//
// WHAT IT IS, PRECISELY. A conservative static shape analysis of the request
// JSON, run BEFORE a single node is constructed (Listener/Interval/BucketTime
// all spawn threads in their builders, so rejecting afterwards would leak
// work). It answers one question: *is the value arriving at the terminal
// statically certain to be a Record?* Certain — never "probably". A false
// positive would refuse a request that works today; a false negative only
// leaves the pre-existing silent drop in place, which is the strictly safer
// direction while the restriction is temporary.
//
// Measured against the checked-in corpus at the commit that introduced this:
// **0 of 272 `tests/treebuilder/corpus_requests.json` entries are refused** —
// the corpus uses only Worker / AtomicAccessor / Listener / Aggregate /
// Interval / SymbolSplit, and constructs no Record at all.
//
// KNOWN CONSERVATIVE GAPS, recorded rather than hidden. Each of these emits a
// Record the analysis calls `Opaque`, so the silent drop survives there:
//   * `Field` projecting a nested Record out of a `Pack{a: Pack{...}}`.
//   * `Worker` / `Expr` / `AtomicAccessor` / `Listener`, whose runtime value
//     is a feed- or function-supplied `ArgType` this analysis cannot see.
// None is reachable from anything the corpus or forum authors today, and all
// of them stop mattering when ENC-1295 lands.

// ---------- ENC-1336: a fan-in as a pipeline stage with something upstream ----------
//
// SPEC specs/2026-09-20-gma-join-correctness/SPEC.md §5 Q7 (ruled 2026-09-20 by
// ENC-1334), D5 as amended by that ruling.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Under D5 the chain is
//
//     Listener(streamKey, field) -> node subtree -> pipeline stages -> terminal
//
// and each arrow is a real edge. A FAN-IN breaks that arrow. Its data comes
// from its own DECLARED `inputs`; a value arriving from upstream is a CLOCK for
// those inputs and is never forwarded on — that is the §5 Q1 ruling, and
// `CompositeRoot::onValue` below is where it lives: it forwards to
// `clockTargets_` and TO NOTHING ELSE. So when a fan-in sits in the `pipeline`
// array with anything built upstream of it, that upstream's output is consumed
// and dropped. Where the fan-in's declared inputs are all `Listener`s —
// 45 of the corpus's 52 fan-in requests are that shape — `clockTargets_` is
// EMPTY and the upstream's output is discarded in total silence: no log, no
// metric, no error, and a chart that is missing a value nobody can explain.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED — AND IT IS NOT NOTHING. SPEC §5 Q7 says "Nothing to
// forum ... it cannot emit a fan-in pipeline stage at all". That is true of
// `Aggregate` (forum's translator always turns the edge-fanned join into the
// Request's Node) and FALSE of `Pack` and `Let`, which forum treats as
// config-driven LINEAR stages (`forum/internal/pipelinetranslate/
// config_mapping.go` `case "pack"` / `case "let"`) and `translateStage` will
// place at ANY index of the chain. Driving forum's real `Translate()` on three
// graphs produced, verbatim:
//
//   Listener->Pack->Filter->Field->Responder  (the ENC-672 demo headline)
//       -> pipeline:[Pack, Filter, Field]                      ACCEPTED here
//   Listener->Filter->Pack->Field->Responder
//       -> pipeline:[Filter, Pack, Field]                      REFUSED here
//   Listener->{2 accessors}->Aggregate->Pack->Field->Responder
//       -> node:Aggregate + pipeline:[Pack, Field]             REFUSED here
//
// So forum CAN author both refused shapes, and this refusal stops them
// building. Measured at the pre-change commit `b273278`, all three emit the
// IDENTICAL sequence — the Pack's own record, projected — because the upstream
// half really is thrown away: deleting the `Filter`/`Aggregate` changes
// nothing. That is the defect, not a cost of removing it. But the honest
// statement is "two shapes forum can emit stop building", not "nothing to
// forum", and the first ACCEPTED row above is why the accept half must not be
// widened by one condition: it is forum's flagship graph.
//
// WHY IT IS A BUILD-TIME REFUSAL AND NOT A DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOUR. **0 of the 272
// `tests/treebuilder/corpus_requests.json` entries have a fan-in in a pipeline
// stage** (all 52 `Aggregate`s are under `node`; the corpus contains no `Pack`
// and no `Let` — its only pipeline stage type at all is `Worker`, 104 uses). So
// no corpus count, no build smoke test and no value assertion goes red on the
// day someone first authors the shape. That is exactly D7/ENC-1293's argument,
// made by the same evidence, and it reaches the same verdict: convert a silent
// drop into a loud build error. A refusal can be lifted if a use appears; a
// silent discard that ships becomes behaviour someone depends on.
//
// THE ONE ACCEPTED PLACEMENT IS NOT AN EXCEPTION — IT IS §5 Q1. A fan-in as the
// FIRST element of `pipeline`/`stages` in a request with NO `node` key has the
// head `Listener` as its upstream and nothing else, because `midHead` starts at
// `terminal` either way: that is bit-for-bit the wiring the same fan-in gets
// under `node` with no pipeline, which §5 Q1 already ruled correct. Refusing it
// would refuse a shape semantically identical to the blessed one and would
// break requests that work today — `RecordTerminalTest`'s
// `Pack -> Field -> Responder` and `ClientSessionTest`'s
// `SubscribeAcceptsPackFieldResponder` are both written in exactly that form.
//
// RECURSIVE SINCE ENC-1344, AND KEYED ON A PROPERTY RATHER THAN A TYPE NAME
// (SPEC §5 Q7, Corrections C13.3 / C13.5).
//
// ENC-1336 scoped this check non-recursive and said so out loud; its refuter
// then measured that the premise behind the scoping was false. SPEC §5 Q7 said
// "today no builder reachable from a pipeline stage takes a sub-node that could
// hold a fan-in except a fan-in's own `inputs`, so the question is currently
// empty." **That was false.** `Chain`'s builder ends `return curDown;` — it
// hands back its inner builder's head verbatim — so
// `node:Worker{last}` + `pipeline:[Chain{stages:[Aggregate{ask, bid}]}]` made
// the STAGE HEAD literally a `CompositeRoot`, built without refusal, and
// discarded the `node`'s output exactly as the un-wrapped shape did.
// Reproduced identically through `Tee`.
//
// THE ENUMERATION, which is what ENC-1344 owes and what a longer
// `isFanInType` list can never substitute for. All 19 registered node names,
// classified by ONE question: when a value arrives at this builder's built
// head, which sub-JSON does that value reach?
//
//   builder          sub-JSON built     on the UPSTREAM VALUE's path?
//   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   Aggregate        inputs[]           it IS the fan-in — stop and judge
//   Pack             fields{}           it IS the fan-in — stop and judge

//                                       (`return curDown;`) — the pass-through
//                                       property. AND every later stage has
//                                       stages[i-1] built directly upstream of
//                                       it, inside the Chain, unconditionally.
//   Tee              outputs[]          YES — `Tee::onValue` pushes the value
//                                       into EVERY output head. Note `Tee` is
//                                       NOT a fan-in and builds no
//                                       `CompositeRoot`; it reproduces the gap
//                                       by forwarding INTO one. That is why
//                                       "the head is a CompositeRoot" is not
//                                       the whole property.
//   Switch           cases[], default   YES — `Switch::onValue` routes the
//                                       value into one branch head.
//   GroupSplit       child              YES — routes the value per group key
//                                       (the child is built lazily, per key,
//                                       but from the same JSON).
//   SymbolSplit      child              YES — legacy alias, same builder.

//   BucketTime       child              (source node) and the child is driven
//                                       by the TIMER. The timer is a clock, so
//                                       the child is entered in the clock-only
//                                       disposition, not the has-upstream one.

//
// So the implemented property is not "this stage's built head is a
// `CompositeRoot`" — that catches `Chain` and misses `Tee`, `Switch` and
// `GroupSplit`, which return their own node and still hand the upstream value
// straight into one. It is:
//
//     A FAN-IN IS REFUSED WHEREVER A VALUE-PRODUCING NODE IS BUILT DIRECTLY
//     UPSTREAM OF IT ON THE COMPOSED CHAIN, HOWEVER MANY WRAPPERS DEEP.
//
// `hasUpstream` below carries exactly that, and it is FALSE at the three
// clock-only positions: the `node` subtree's own head, `pipeline[0]` of a
// request with no `node`, and a timer's `child`. There the only thing upstream
// is the head `Listener` (or the timer), which §5 Q1 already ruled is a CLOCK
// and not a data source. THE ONE ACCEPTED PLACEMENT IS THEREFORE UNCHANGED,
// which is why `Pack` at `pipeline[0]` with no `node` — forum's flagship
// ENC-672 graph — still builds and still emits.
//
// SCOPE OF THE WIDENING, MEASURED, BOTH HALVES.
//   * Corpus: 0 of 272 entries change verdict. The corpus contains no `Chain`,
//     `Tee`, `Switch`, `Pack` or `Let` at all — its node vocabulary is
//     `Worker` 161, `AtomicAccessor` 119, `Listener` 94, `Aggregate` 52,
//     `Interval` 24, `SymbolSplit` 10 — and its only pipeline stage type is
//     `Worker`. `NoCheckedInCorpusRequestIsRefusedForFanInPlacement` is the
//     standing gate on that, and it is the instrument for the accept half.
//   * forum: UNREACHABLE. forum's stage vocabulary is the 13 `case` labels in
//     `translateStage`, and there is no `chain` and no `tee` kind anywhere in
//     it (ENC-1343, Corrections C13.2). The un-wrapped shapes forum DOES emit
//     (C13.2 / ENC-1383) are unaffected — they were already refused.
//
// So this closes a LATENT gap before anything depends on it; it is not a live
// bug being fixed, and it must not be reported as one. Being corpus-invisible
// AND forum-invisible is also why `FanInWrappedInAChainIsRefused` is the only
// thing that will ever go red on it — which is precisely why it is a test and
// not a note.

//
// THE OUTER `Listener(streamKey, field)` IS A CLOCK, NOT A DATA SOURCE.
// A request carrying `node` always builds a head Listener (`buildForRequest`
// throws without `streamKey`/`field`), and for a FAN-IN node that Listener is
// not one of the join's members — the members are the node's own declared
// `inputs`. So the head Listener's value must never enter the join's buffer;
// it exists to *clock* inputs that have no clock of their own.
//
// `clockTargets_` is that set, and `onValue` forwards to it AND TO NOTHING
// ELSE. It is filled by each fan-in builder from its DECLARED INPUT HEADS
// only, and only from those whose declared subtree contains no `Listener`
// (see `declaredInputIsSelfClocked`).
//
// `roots_` IS NOT THAT SET, AND MUST NEVER BE USED AS ONE. It is a lifecycle
// list: every fan-in builder appends the fan-in node ITSELF to it (`agg`,
// `pack`, the `Tee`s and the body head below), because Listeners hold only a
// weak_ptr to their downstream. Forwarding the clock to `roots_` — or to "the
// roots that are not Dispatcher-subscribed", which was the rule's first and
// retracted wording — pushes the clock's value straight into
// `Aggregate::onValue` -> `buf_[sv.symbol]` AS A JOIN MEMBER, manufacturing
// SPEC section 1.1 defect 2 inside the builder. `ClockIsNeverAJoinMember` in
// tests/treebuilder/ComposedChainTest.cpp is the gate on that.
//
// SCOPE. Only the three fan-in builders construct a CompositeRoot. A
// single-input transform node (Worker, AtomicAccessor, Interval, GroupSplit)
// is returned as its own head and is wired to the head Listener directly, so
// for it the outer Listener IS the data source — today and after D5. All 162

// corpus entries (ids 111-115, 192, 200) a DEAD join today rather than the
// "two live chains" SPEC section 1.1 defect 1 describes (corrected there by

//
// The test is structural and build-time, over the request JSON, and is never a
// property of the authored `streamKey`/`field` — which is why all 52 affected
// corpus entries are RE-WIRED and none is re-authored.
//
// THREE THINGS SELF-CLOCK, and the list is exhaustive by construction — a node
// is self-clocked iff something other than its upstream calls its `onValue`:
//   * `Listener`      — the Dispatcher pushes to it.
//   * `Interval` /
//     `BucketTime`    — a timer thread drives their child directly
//                       (`timerLoop`). Their own `onValue` is an explicit
//                       no-op ("source node: no upstream input"), so before
//                       ENC-1290 named them here the clock was forwarded to
//                       them and was correct ONLY by accident, via that no-op.
//                       Saying it out loud costs nothing and stops the next
//                       edit to `Interval::onValue` from silently double-firing
//                       every timer-headed join input.
//
// `Ref` IS NOT ONE OF THEM, and an earlier draft of this function wrongly said
// it was. A `Ref`'s own head is a `RefStub` no-op, so clocking it is harmless —
// but the test runs over the WHOLE declared subtree, so `Ref -> true` poisoned
// every enclosing node: a `Let` whose bindings are pull-only and whose body
// merely mentions a `Ref` (i.e. every non-degenerate `Let`) was declared
// self-clocked, and its join stayed dead — the exact failure this rule exists
// to end for the 7 pull-only corpus entries. Caught by adversarial review; the
// `Let` cases in tests/treebuilder/ComposedChainTest.cpp are the gate, and no
// test covered the clause before.
//
// CONSERVATIVE DIRECTION. Returning `true` (do not clock) reproduces the
// pre-ENC-1290 behaviour exactly, so it is the safe answer when we cannot
// tell — hence depth overflow -> `true`. Returning a wrong `false` is the
