// ENC-1005 / SPEC specs/2026-09-20-gma-join-correctness D3, D4.
//
// A SERIALIZING EXECUTOR over `ThreadPool`. Tasks posted to one Strand run
//   * one at a time, and
//   * in the order they were posted,
// while still running on the shared pool's worker threads. It is the classic
// "strand over an executor" construction — the same guarantee `asio::strand`
// gives, expressed over the executor GMA actually has.
//
// WHY NOT `asio::strand`, which D3 names. GMA's node graph does not run on an
// `asio::io_context`: it runs on `gma::rt::ThreadPool` (`src/rt/ThreadPool.cpp`),
// a hand-rolled mutex+condvar queue with no asio executor behind it. The only
// `io_context` in the process belongs to `WebSocketServer`/`ClientSession` and
// drives sockets. Minting a real `asio::strand` would therefore have meant
// moving every node's compute onto the socket I/O threads — a far larger change
// than D3 asks for, and one that puts unbounded user compute in front of the
// read loop. This class is the same abstraction bound to the right executor;
// the deviation is in the mechanism, not in the guarantee.
//
// THREAD COUNT DOES NOT CHANGE. A Strand owns no thread. It occupies one pool
// worker only while it has work, and N strands still occupy up to N cores —
// which is why SPEC §5 Q2 rules the single-subscription regression acceptable.
//
// LIFETIME. A running strand holds a `shared_ptr` to itself for the duration of
// its drain task, so a Strand whose last external owner drops while work is
// queued still finishes that work rather than freeing itself underneath a pool
// thread.

  // ENC-1338 — WHICH SITE MINTED THIS STRAND.
  //
  // D3 names ONE mint site: `ClientSession::handleSubscribe`, one strand per
  // subscription. `tree::buildForRequest` mints a second one as a backstop so
  // ordering is a property of the DAG rather than of the caller's discipline
  // (see the comment there). The two are behaviourally indistinguishable from
  // outside — which is exactly why ENC-1005's mutations M7 (delete the
  // `handleSubscribe` mint) and M10 (unguard it) reddened NOTHING: the backstop
  // silently supplied a replacement and every assertion in the suite stayed
  // true. The production guarantee rested on a line that could be deleted with
  // a green suite.
  //
  // This tag is the missing observable. It is a `const char*` literal, set once
  // at construction and never read on any hot path, that says which site minted
  // this strand. `tests/ws/SubscriptionStrandMintTest.cpp` reads it off the
  // head `Listener` of a subscription driven through a REAL WebSocket session
  // and asserts it is the session site — so a DAG that silently fell back to
  // the backstop names itself.
  //
  // It is not test-only scaffolding: with two mint sites and a granularity
  // argument attached to each, "which executor is this DAG on, and who gave it
  // one" is a question a log line should be able to answer.
  //
  // DEFAULT IS DELIBERATELY NOT "buildForRequest". Anything that did not go
  // through a site that names itself reads `unattributed`, which today means
  // the backstop or a test-constructed strand.
  static constexpr const char* kUnattributedOrigin = "unattributed";

  // ENC-1338 — THE TAG IS A CAPABILITY, NOT A STRING, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
  //
  // An earlier draft of this took the origin as a plain `const char*` with the
  // session's literal hidden in an anonymous namespace, on the theory that only
  // the production mint could spell it. **That was measurably wrong, and an
  // adversarial review of ENC-1338 broke it**: the literal was reachable both
  // through the public `SubscriptionStrandMint::origin()` and — because an
  // anonymous-namespace member is still visible through the enclosing namespace
  // name for the rest of its translation unit — directly from `handleSubscribe`
  // itself. So an UNGUARDED mint inlined at the call site that simply kept the
  // tag passed every test. The gate turned on whether the person inlining it
  // happened to drop a tag the comment right above told them identifies the
  // site. That is a convention, not a gate.
  //
  // `Attribution` fixes it by construction: its constructor is private and its
  // only friend is `gma::server::SubscriptionStrandMint`. No other code in the
  // engine can produce one, so an attributed `Strand` cannot be built anywhere
  // but inside the guarded mint — a forged tag is a COMPILE ERROR rather than a
  // green test. `origin()` is therefore a statement about where the strand came
  // from, not about what string somebody passed.
  //
  // `name` must have static storage duration (a string literal). `Strand` keeps
  // the pointer rather than copying it; the one producer passes a file-local
  // `constexpr const char*`.
