// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ENC-1289 — real value assertions (SPEC specs/2026-09-20-gma-join-correctness
// D8, §1.2).
//
// Everything above this line asserts `chain.head != nullptr`. That is a build
// smoke test: it cannot distinguish a join that computes the right answer from
// one that computes `+1.00` where the truth is `0.02`. What follows drives a
// deterministic tick sequence into the *real* DAG of a named corpus entry and
// asserts what comes out.
//
// WHAT IS REAL HERE. The DAG is built by `tree::buildForRequest` from the
// verbatim `request` object of the corpus file — the same entry, read from the
// same file, that `AllCorpusRequestsBuild` iterates. Values enter through
// `Dispatcher::onTick`. No node is stubbed, subclassed or reimplemented; the
// single substitution is the terminal, which `buildForRequest` takes as a
// parameter and which `AllCorpusRequestsBuild` already substitutes.
//
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE CONCURRENCY PROBLEM, AND HOW THESE TESTS HANDLE IT
//
// SPEC §1.1 names four defects. Two of them are *state-machine* defects and
// two are *ordering* defects, and they need opposite test strategies:
//
//   defect 2 — `Aggregate` counts VALUES, not distinct inputs
//              (`Aggregate::onValue` pre-ENC-1291: `buf_[sv.symbol].vals` grew and
//              fires at `>= arity_`), so a two-input node completes a "tuple"
//              from two values of ONE input.
//   defect 3 — the correlation key is `sv.symbol`, so no cross-streamKey join
//              exists at all; two symbols occupy two independent buffers.
//   defect 4 — `Listener::onValue` posts every value to a shared `ThreadPool`
//              queue, so two ticks from one Listener execute concurrently and
//              the join pairs across ticks.
//
// Defects 2 and 3 are properties of `Aggregate`'s buffer, held under its own
// mutex. They do NOT depend on scheduling: the counting is the same at one
// thread as at sixteen. So the tests for them run at **threads=1** and are
// exactly reproducible — no seed, no repetition budget, no flake.
//
// Defect 4 is a race, and it is the trap in this ticket. At **threads=1** the
// join is correct BY CONSTRUCTION: `ThreadPool`'s queue is FIFO, one worker
// drains it in order, and `Dispatcher::onTick`'s inner listener container is a
// `std::map`, so `ask` is notified before `bid` deterministically (`"ask" <
// "bid"`). The committed probe at
// specs/2026-09-20-gma-join-correctness/probe/ measured 0 wrong tuples in
// 1,200,000 consecutive single-threaded tuples. **A value assertion written at
// one thread is therefore green by construction against the very defect it
// names.**
//
// So the value assertion is written twice, deliberately:
//
//   `Corpus86_SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents_SingleThreadControl` runs the identical
//   driver and the identical checker at threads=1. It PASSES today. Its job is
//   to prove the checker is capable of returning "clean" — a checker that
//   always reports corruption gates nothing — and to pin, in the suite itself,
//   the fact that one thread hides this defect completely.
//
//   `Corpus86_SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents` runs the same checker at threads=4 —
//   the worst width the probe measured (pooled 6.62-7.27% wrong tuples over
//   1.2M tuples; per-1000-tick-run 1.70%-13.80%, minimum over 1,200 runs
//   1.70%, never zero). It FAILS today.
//
// WHAT THE THREAD-COUNT CHOICE COVERS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Four threads is
// one point on a curve that is NOT monotonic (probe: 2 threads 2.05%, 4
// threads 6.66%, 8 threads 3.06%, 16 threads 2.62%). These tests do not sweep
// widths — that is the probe's job, and the probe is committed for exactly
// that reason. They pick the width with the largest measured effect so the
// gate's detection probability is highest, and they say so here rather than
// implying the choice was principled beyond that.
//
// THE REPETITION BUDGET. `kRaceReps` x `kRaceTicks` ticks yields
// `kRaceReps * kRaceTicks` tuples. Taking the probe's *minimum* observed
// per-run rate (1.70%) as a pessimistic p, the probability this gate sees zero
// wrong tuples and passes by luck is (1 - 0.017)^(reps*ticks): at 4 x 1000
// that is e^-68, i.e. ~2e-30. Even at a p of 0.001 — sixteen times below
// anything measured — it is e^-4 ~ 1.8%. The budget is stated, not assumed.
//
// WHAT IS NOT COVERED HERE. SPEC §1.1 defect 1 (a request carrying BOTH `node`
// and `pipeline` builds two live chains into one terminal) has no assertion
// below. Its correct shape is `Q1`, still open in the SPEC, and it blocks
// ENC-1290; pinning an expectation before Q1 is answered would pin a guess.
// The tests below sidestep it instead: corpus 86 is driven with `bid`/`ask`
// only (never `lastPrice`), which leaves the outer `Listener(AAPL,lastPrice)`
// silent and makes the terminal stream unambiguously the join's output.
//
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED (ENC-1289, GMA_V3@7928d78, g++ 16.2.1, AMD Ryzen 7
// 5800XT 8C/16T, Fedora 44, Release; 1-minute load average 12.4-17.6
// throughout — other agents were compiling)
//
//   Corpus86_JoinMustNotCompleteFromOneInputAlone   red 40/40 runs, and every
//       run reported the SAME numbers (8 arrivals, 4 tuples, 4 same-side).
//   Corpus87_CrossSymbolJoinNeverPairsOneSideWithItself
//                                                   red 40/40 runs, same
//       numbers every run (6 tuples, 6 same-side).
//   Corpus86_SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents                red 40/40 runs; wrong-tuple
//       rate per invocation 3.62% - 8.22% of 4000 tuples (mean ~6.4%),
//       consistent with the probe's pooled 6.62-7.27% at this width. At the
//       lowest rate observed here the chance of a clean pass is (1-0.0362)^4000
//       ~ 1e-64; at the probe's all-time minimum single-run rate (1.70%) it is
//       ~1e-30.
//       ENC-1005 (2026-09-20): GREEN 40/40 after the per-request strand —
//       160,000 further tuples at threads=4, 0 wrong. The rates above are what
//       the same binary measured the day before, and are what makes the green
//       mean something.
//   Corpus86_SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents_SingleThreadControl
//                                                   green 40/40 runs
//       = 40,000 further single-threaded tuples, 0 wrong.
//
// FALSIFIED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. A check never seen fail is not a check; a check
// that can only fail is not one either. Each assertion was run against a
// throwaway prototype of the fixes it names (NOT committed, reverted after
// measurement):
//
//   port-indexed fan-in alone (a prototype of ENC-1291/D2: one slot per
//       declared input, emit only when all are filled)
//         -> JoinMustNotCompleteFromOneInputAlone            RED  -> GREEN
//         -> Corpus87_CrossSymbolJoinNeverPairsOneSideWithItself
//                                                            RED  -> GREEN
//         -> SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents      still RED, and its failures changed
//            character completely: 0 same-side, 0 sign-flip, 1303/3979 (32.75%)
//            CROSS_TICK. Exactly what SPEC D3 predicts is left once the
//            counting defect is gone, and evidence the classifier discriminates
//            between the two defects rather than reporting one number.
//   + ordered delivery (a prototype of ENC-1005/D3: both ThreadPool hops made
//       synchronous)
//         -> all four GREEN at threads=4.
//
// ENC-1005 SHIPPED ordered delivery and it flipped EXACTLY ONE of the three, as
// the line above predicts for the ordering defect alone: SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents
// RED -> GREEN, and the two state-machine gates (defects 2 and 3, both driven at
// threads=1) unmoved. The shipped form is not "both hops synchronous": hop one
// (Dispatcher -> Listener) is inline, hop two (Listener -> the DAG) is a
// per-request `rt::Strand`, so the compute is still off the ingress thread and
// the thread count is unchanged.
//
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// SOME OF THESE FAIL TODAY, ON PURPOSE, AND `ctest` IS STILL GREEN
//
// SPEC D8: "an instrument that cannot fail is not a gate. This is sequenced
// first deliberately." So three of the four assertions below were red against
// the engine at ENC-1289 and were MEANT to be. One still is; the bookkeeping
// of which is at the foot of this block.
//
// They are not disabled, skipped or commented out. Each is registered in
// CMakeLists.txt as its own ctest case with `WILL_FAIL TRUE`: the assertion
// executes on every run, ctest reports the case as a pass *because* the
// assertion fails, and the suite stays green for the other sessions building
// this repo. A red `ctest` on master would have turned "is the build green?"
// into a question everyone has to re-investigate, and the answer decays to
// "ignore those three" within a day.
//
// The property that makes this better than a DISABLED_ test: it unwinds
// itself. When the fix lands the assertion starts passing, `WILL_FAIL` flips
// its ctest case RED, and whoever landed the fix has to come here and remove
// the marker. A disabled test rots silently; this one demands attention
// exactly once, at the moment it becomes wrong.
//
//   Corpus87_CrossSymbolJoinNeverPairsOneSideWithItself
//                                                  -> ENC-1292 (declared `by`,
//                                                     D1)
//
// TWO, not three, as of ENC-1005 (2026-09-20). `Corpus86_SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents`
// was the third; SPEC D3's per-request strand landed, it went green, its
// `WILL_FAIL` block was deleted and the count pinned by
// `gma_enc1289_expected_failures_really_failed` went from 3 to 2. It now runs
// inside the main `gma_tests` case. This paragraph unwinding itself one line at
// a time is the mechanism working as designed.
//
// ONE, not two, as of ENC-1291 (2026-09-20). SPEC D2's port-indexed fan-in
// landed and `Corpus86_JoinMustNotCompleteFromOneInputAlone` went green; its
// block is gone and the pinned count is 1.
//
// **AND THE SURVIVOR DID NOT STAY RED BY ITSELF — READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING
// IT.** ENC-1289's own prototype measurement four screens above predicted
// `Corpus87_...` would go RED -> GREEN under port-indexing alone, and it did.
// It went green VACUOUSLY: port-indexing puts AAPL and MSFT in two different
// `buf_[sv.symbol]` entries which each stay half-filled forever, so the join
// emits NOTHING, `joined` is empty, the same-side loop never runs and
// `sameSide == 0` holds over zero tuples. That is D1's locked `by:"streamKey"`
// default behaving correctly and the cross-symbol join still not existing —
// the branch ENC-1289 flagged as "honest but weak". ENC-1291 therefore added
// an explicit anti-vacuity ASSERT to that test (see the block above it) so it
// is red for the real reason instead of green for a hollow one. The marker
// stays; ENC-1292 clears it by making the join actually emit six mixed tuples
// under `by:"none"`.
//
// `Corpus86_SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents_SingleThreadControl` is deliberately NOT
// registered that way. It is an ordinary always-green test — inverting it
// would assert that the checker must never return clean, which is the opposite
// of what a control is for.
//
// To see the real verdicts rather than the inverted ones, run the binary
// directly: `./gma_tests --gtest_filter='CorpusValueAssertions.*'`. That is
// also the form the ENC-1065 `--gtest_repeat` check needs (full, unfiltered).

// ─── The join's observation point (ENC-1290) ───────────────────────────────
//
// Every assertion in this block is about the JOIN: which values `Aggregate`
// pairs into a tuple. Until ENC-1290 the join's raw members reached the
// terminal directly, because a request carrying both `node` and `pipeline`
// built TWO live chains into one Responder (SPEC §1.1 defect 1) and the
// `node` chain was one of them. Driving only the join's own input fields left
// the other chain silent, so the terminal stream WAS the join's output.
//
// D5 composed the two into one chain, so for corpus 86 and 87 the terminal now
// sees `Worker{fn:"diff"}` output instead. That is the fix working, and it
// moves the observation point rather than changing what the join does. Left
// alone, these tests would have gone quietly wrong in three different ways —
// all three measured before this change landed:
//
//   * Corpus86_SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents      — HOLLOWED OUT. `decodeBidAsk`
//     decodes 0 of 6 arrivals, every tuple scores UNDECODABLE, and it stays
//     red for a reason ENC-1005 can never clear.
//   * ..._SingleThreadControl               — the same checker, and it is NOT
//     in GMA_ENC1289_EXPECTED_FAILURES, so it runs inside the MAIN `gma_tests`
//     ctest case and took the primary target red.
//   * Corpus87_CrossSymbolJoin...           — BROKEN. Its `>= 900.0` filter
//     (there to drop the second chain's small diffs) kept 0 values, the test
//     passed vacuously, and its WILL_FAIL ctest case flipped to FAILED —
//     taking `gma_enc1289_expected_failures_really_failed` with it.
//
// So each of them drives the corpus entry's `node` WITHOUT its pipeline. The
// request is still built by the real `tree::buildForRequest` and driven
// through the real `Dispatcher`, the `node` is the corpus entry's own
// verbatim, and `tests/treebuilder/corpus_requests.json` is NOT touched. The
// assertions, their thread counts, their tick encodings and their expected
// red/green states are all byte-for-byte what ENC-1289 committed.
//

// ═══ 1. Defect 2 — the join counts values, not inputs ══════════════════════
//
// DETERMINISTIC, at threads=1, and red today for a reason that has nothing to
// do with scheduling.
//
// Corpus 86 declares a two-input join: Listener(AAPL,ask) and
// Listener(AAPL,bid). Drive ticks that carry ONLY `ask`. The `bid` input never
// fires once. A two-input join cannot complete a single tuple, so the terminal
// must receive nothing.
//
// Today `Aggregate` buffers per `sv.symbol` with no input index and fires at
// `vals.size() >= arity_`, so eight `ask` values become four "complete tuples"
// of {ask(n), ask(n+1)} — a pairwise spread of exactly -1.00 where the truth
// is 0.02. That is SPEC §0's headline number, reproduced here with no race,
// no repetition and no thread-count dependence.
//
// GREEN as of ENC-1291 (port-indexed fan-in + arity enforcement, SPEC D2),
// 2026-09-20. Each declared input now terminates in its own `InputPort` and the
// join completes only when every port has contributed, so eight `ask` values
// with no `bid` complete nothing. The `WILL_FAIL` registration and the marker
// in `GMA_ENC1289_EXPECTED_FAILURES` were removed in that same commit, and the
// count pinned by `gma_enc1289_expected_failures_really_failed` went 2 -> 1.
// The assertion itself is untouched.
//
// IT IS NOT VACUOUS, and the thing that proves it is a SIBLING test rather than
// anything in here: `Corpus86_SpreadIsExactlyTwoCents` and its
// `_SingleThreadControl` twin drive the SAME corpus entry through the SAME
// driver with BOTH sides ticking, and assert that the join emits tuples and
// that every one of them is {ask(n), bid(n)}. So "0 arrivals" below cannot be
// the driver, the terminal or the corpus entry being inert — it is the missing
// `bid` and nothing else. Break the driver and those two go red, loudly.

// ═══ 2c. ENC-1290 — the CONTROL on corpus 87's observation point ═══════════
//
// PASSES today, and must keep passing.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS, IN THE PAST TENSE (ENC-1292). Gate 3 below carries a
// `>= 900.0` filter and an assertion that the filter dropped nothing. While
// gate 3 was registered `WILL_FAIL TRUE` that assertion could not gate
// anything from where it sat: the case was *required* to fail, so ctest read a
// second failure inside it as the expected one, and injecting the exact
// regression it guards against (stop stripping the pipeline, so the terminal
// sees `Worker{fn:"diff"}` output and the filter keeps 0 of 12 arrivals) left
// `gma_enc1289_xfail_no_cross_symbol_join` reporting **Passed**.
//
// That registration is GONE — ENC-1292 cleared the gate and deleted the whole
// expected-failure block from CMakeLists.txt — so gate 3's own assertions now
// gate normally. This control is kept anyway, and it is not redundant: it
// drives the entry BOTH ways from one corpus row, so it is the only thing that
// measures the DEFAULT's zero against a driver it simultaneously proves is
// live.
//
// Corpus 86 already has such a control (2a, and it is what caught D5 hollowing
// out gate 2). Corpus 87 had none. This is it: the same drive as gate 3, with
// only the soundness of the observation point asserted and no claim about the
// join's correctness — so it is green now, stays green through ENC-1291 and
// ENC-1292, and goes red the moment gate 3 starts measuring the wrong stream.
//
// ENC-1291 (2026-09-20) FOUND IT GREEN FOR A REASON IT WAS NOT WRITTEN FOR:
// since SPEC D2's port-indexed fan-in a cross-streamKey join completed
// nothing, so `d.arrivals` was 0 and `raw == d.arrivals` held as `0 == 0` —
// the filter could not drop anything because there was nothing to drop. It
// PINNED that zero so the control would fail the moment corpus 87 started
// emitting, and told whoever landed ENC-1292 to re-arm it.
//
// ENC-1292 (2026-09-20) RE-ARMS IT, AND THE PIN IS GONE. The control now
// drives corpus 87 BOTH WAYS from the one corpus entry, which is the only
// shape that can be non-vacuous in both directions:
//
//   * as authored (no `by`) -> 0 arrivals, which is D6's no-migration
//     guarantee stated as a measurement rather than a promise: a stored forum
//     graph carries no `by` and must keep meaning exactly what it meant;
//   * with `by:"none"` declared -> 12 arrivals, all of them raw AAPL/MSFT
//     prices, so `raw == arrivals` is a LIVE check over a non-empty set and
//     gate 3 below is demonstrably measuring the join's own members.
//
// Neither branch can hold over an empty set: the first asserts an exact zero
// against a driver the second proves is live, and the second asserts an exact
// twelve.

// ═══ 3. Defect 3 — the correlation key is `symbol`, so no cross-symbol join ═
//
// DETERMINISTIC, at threads=1. GREEN as of ENC-1292; red for everything before
// it, and for two different reasons in succession.
//
// Corpus 87 "Price difference between AAPL and MSFT" declares a two-input join
// across two streamKeys. Drive six ticks on each side. Every completed tuple
// must contain one value from each side — that is what "join" means.
//
// THE THREE STATES THIS TEST HAS BEEN IN, because the middle one is the
// failure class this project exists to remove and it was reached by a FIX:
//
//   1. Before ENC-1291: `buf_[sv.symbol]` gave AAPL and MSFT one independent
//      buffer each and each fired every second value, so the terminal received
//      six tuples of {AAPL, AAPL} and {MSFT, MSFT} — "a price difference
//      between AAPL and MSFT" computed without ever looking at both. RED,
//      honestly.
//   2. After ENC-1291 (port-indexed fan-in, SPEC D2): each declared input got
//      its own port, AAPL filled port 0 of one buffer and MSFT port 1 of
//      another, NEITHER completed, and the terminal saw ZERO arrivals. Every
//      assertion here then held over an empty tuple list and the test would
//      have gone GREEN HAVING CHECKED NOTHING. ENC-1289 predicted this in
//      writing ("can pass vacuously under D1's locked default — honest but
//      weak"); ENC-1291 measured it, added the anti-vacuity ASSERT below, and
//      deliberately left the xfail marker in place rather than bank the
//      vacuous green.
//   3. ENC-1292 (declared `by`, SPEC D1): the request is driven with
//      `by:"none"` declared and the join emits SIX MIXED TUPLES. The
//      anti-vacuity ASSERT, the `sameSide == 0` EXPECT and everything else
//      below are now checking a non-empty set, and the marker is gone.
//
// WHAT "STRENGTHENED" MEANS HERE, concretely. `sameSide == 0` over six tuples
// is necessary and nowhere near sufficient: a join emitting six tuples of
// {AAPL(n), MSFT(n+3)} would satisfy it. So this test now pins the EXACT
// tuples — count, membership, declared port order, and the exact arithmetic
// truth of the natural-language request ("AAPL minus MSFT" is -4000.00 on
// every tick, by construction of the encoding) — plus the output identity the
// join emits under, which is SPEC section 5 Q6 and had no gate at all.
//
// THE `by` IS INJECTED INTO A COPY; `tests/treebuilder/corpus_requests.json`
// IS NOT TOUCHED. See `nodeWithJoinByNone` above the driver for why that
// boundary matters: the unmodified entry is the baseline the DEFAULT is
// measured against, one test up, and deleting it would make D6's no-migration
// guarantee unmeasurable.
//
// The ASSERT is deliberately on `d.arrivals` rather than on `joined.size()`:
// `joined` is what the `>= 900.0` filter left, so asserting on it would confuse
// "the join emitted nothing" with "the filter dropped everything", which are
// different defects with different owners.
//
// Corpus 87 also carries `pipeline:[Worker{fn:"diff"}]`. SPEC section 1.1
// defect 1 wired that as a SECOND live chain into the same terminal, and the
// `>= 900.0` filter below existed to drop its values. ENC-1290/D5 composed the
// chains, so this test drives corpus 87's `node` alone (see the ENC-1290 note
// above the driver) and there is no second chain left to filter — which the
// assertion next to the filter checks rather than assumes.
