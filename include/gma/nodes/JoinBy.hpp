// THE DECLARED CORRELATION KEY FOR A FAN-IN JOIN
// ENC-1292 / SPEC specs/2026-09-20-gma-join-correctness D1, D6, section 1.1
// defect 3, and section 5 Q3 (RULED 2026-09-20) and Q6.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. Until ENC-1292 both fan-in nodes keyed their
// pending state on `sv.symbol` — `Aggregate`'s `buf_[sv.symbol]` and `Pack`'s
// `state_.find(sv.symbol)` — so NO JOIN ACROSS TWO STREAMKEYS WAS POSSIBLE.
// That is not a bug in one node; it is the expressiveness ceiling of the whole
// system. Measured: `Aggregate(2)` over AAPL+MSFT with one tick on each side
// emits nothing, and 23 of the 52 `Aggregate` requests in the checked-in
// corpus ask for exactly that join.
//
// So the key is DECLARED IN THE JSON rather than hardcoded:
//
//   `by:"streamKey"`  DEFAULT. Today's semantics — correlate by `sv.symbol`.
//                     Correct for a bid/ask join on one symbol, which is what
//                     29 of the 52 corpus `Aggregate`s are. It is the default
//                     so that every stored forum graph keeps its meaning with
//                     NO MIGRATION (D6): forum emits `Aggregate` as the only
//                     join shape it can produce and its stored graphs are
//                     unmigratable from GMA_V3.
//
//   `by:"none"`       Correlate by PORT ALONE, ignoring the symbol. This is
//                     the cross-symbol join. Every port's values land in one
//                     shared pending tuple, so AAPL on port 0 and MSFT on
//                     port 1 complete each other.
//
// OUTPUT IDENTITY UNDER `by:"none"` (SPEC section 5 Q6, which this header
// answers). D1 originally said a `by:"none"` join "emits under the request's
// own top-level `streamKey`, which `buildForRequest` already holds" — a true
// premise with a conclusion that does not follow, and it is STRUCK in the SPEC
// (Corrections C2.3). The outbound frame serialises `sv.symbol`
// (`ClientSession.cpp`'s `w.Key("streamKey"); w.String(sv.symbol...)`), never
// the request's `streamKey`, so holding the string in the builder puts it
// nowhere on the wire. Left alone, a cross-symbol join would report `AAPL` or
// `MSFT` depending on which side happened to arrive second — under a race.
//
// The design step D1 did not name, taken here:
//
//   * THE FAN-IN NODE ITSELF substitutes the symbol, because it is the only
//     thing that knows both the join key and the request's `streamKey`. The
//     builder passes the request's top-level `streamKey` (`defaultStreamKey`)
//     into the node's constructor; the node emits under it.
//   * THE SUBSTITUTION IS CONDITIONAL ON `by:"none"` AND MUST STAY SO. Under
//     `by:"streamKey"` the per-symbol output identity is correct and D6
//     forbids changing what a stored graph means, so that path emits under
//     `sv.symbol` exactly as before — bit for bit.
//   * A `by:"none"` JOIN WITH NO OUTPUT IDENTITY IS REFUSED, at build time and
//     again in the node's constructor. `buildForRequest` already rejects an
//     empty top-level `streamKey`, so this is reachable only through
//     `buildTree`/`buildNode` with no default — but a join emitting under the
//     empty symbol is a silent wrong answer, which is the shape D7 exists to
//     convert into a loud one.
//   * CONSEQUENCE, STATED BECAUSE IT IS A CONSEQUENCE AND NOT A DETAIL:
//     `Worker` and `Pack` downstream also key their state on `sv.symbol`, so
//     substituting at the fan-in merges their per-symbol state into ONE
//     logical stream. That is what a cross-symbol join wants — "the price
//     difference between AAPL and MSFT" is one series, not two — but it is a
//     real behavioural consequence of the substitution.
//
// `by` IS A CLOSED VOCABULARY (SPEC section 5 Q3, ruled). This is the part that
// is easy to skip and is most of the value. `JsonValidator::validateTree` is an
// explicit open-vocabulary walk — "every member is checked / recursed into
// based on its value's type, not its key name" (src/core/JsonValidator.cpp) —
// it bounds string length, array size and depth and NEVER looks at a key. The
// builders then read named members through `strOr`/`sizeOr` WITH DEFAULTS. So
// without an allowlist, `by:"streamkey"` (mis-cased), `by:"origin"` or
// `by:"typo"` would each pass validation, silently take the `"streamKey"`
// default, and return a PLAUSIBLE WRONG NUMBER with no diagnostic in either
// repo. Hence:
//
//   1. accept `"streamKey"` and `"none"`;
//   2. reject `"origin"` by name, as RESERVED AND NOT IMPLEMENTED — it is
//      exactly the same-upstream-event semantics D2 rejected (a provenance
//      token on the value) and section 4 names as future work, so holding the
//      name stops a future join being given an incompatible spelling;
//   3. reject every other value, mis-casing included, rather than defaulting.
//
// Reserving the name without (3) would be worth very little: the hole is the
// typo, not the future feature.
