# ENC-1005 — SPEC specs/2026-09-20-gma-join-correctness §5 Q2's instrument.
#
# Builds gma_engine and the throughput instrument into a PRIVATE mktemp -d and
# runs the four profiles Q2 asks for. Nothing is written into the repo's own
# build/ directory, so this never collides with a session that is mid-build —
# and nothing is written to a fixed /tmp path, which is the ENC-1222 hazard
# (the scratchpad and /tmp are shared with every other live agent).
#
#   ./run.sh                    # the four profiles, 3 reps, widths 1,2,4,8,16
#   REPS=1 WIDTHS=1,4 ./run.sh  # a quick pass
#   OUT=/path/results.csv ./run.sh
#
# Output is CSV on stdout and, if OUT is set, tee'd to that file. Every row
# carries the 1-minute load average sampled at the start of that rep: this
# machine runs several agents compiling continuously and a throughput figure
# with no load beside it cannot be re-checked.
