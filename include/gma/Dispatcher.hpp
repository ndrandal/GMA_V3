  // died is still SUBSCRIBED and still costs `onTick` work, while delivering
  // nothing anyone can observe). That is exactly the shape a rejected fan-in

  // CONCURRENCY CONTRACT (ENC-791/M11): onTick() may be called from multiple
  // ingress threads concurrently. The per-type computer cache is filled under a
  // lock, but IEventComputer::compute() runs OUTSIDE that lock, so the same
  // cached computer instance can have compute() entered concurrently for the
  // same event type. IEventComputer implementations (which live in connectors/)
  // MUST therefore make compute() safe to call concurrently — either stateless
  // or internally synchronised. The Dispatcher adds no further serialisation.
  //
  // ORDERED DELIVERY REQUIRES SINGLE-THREADED INGRESS PER SYMBOL (ENC-1005,
  // SPEC specs/2026-09-20-gma-join-correctness D3). Read this as a PRECONDITION
  // of D3, not as a property of it.
  //
  // The per-request strand serialises everything DOWNSTREAM of a Listener, and
  // this method's fan-out is upstream of one. Within ONE onTick call the order
  // is deterministic — `_listeners`' inner container is a `std::map<field,...>`,
  // so `ask` precedes `bid` — and `deliver()` preserves it by calling a
  // strand-bearing Listener inline. Two CONCURRENT onTick calls interleave
  // their inline posts, and the strand then faithfully preserves an order that
  // was already scrambled here. Measured on a corpus-86 DAG: 0 of 2000 tuples
  // wrong with one ingress thread, 1596 of 2000 wrong with two (1444 of them
  // `ask` paired with `ask` — SPEC section 1.1 defect 4, back in full).
  //
  // It is not reachable in the shipped server: `src/main.cpp` runs `ioc.run()`
  // on exactly one thread and every ingress source hangs off that one
  // io_context. It is one `for (...) threads.emplace_back([&]{ioc.run();})`
  // away, and that is a change nobody would expect to break join correctness —
  // which is why it is written here, on the contract that permits it, rather
  // than left to be rediscovered. Making D3 hold under concurrent ingress needs
  // a decision ENC-1005 did not have the remit to take: either serialise
  // ingress per symbol, which the paragraph above explicitly refuses, or carry
  // a sequence number on the value — the provenance-token design SPEC D2
  // rejected. Raised on ENC-1005 for the SPEC to rule on.

  // Design: specs/2026-10-14-gma-data-layer/SPEC.md D1, D3, D13;
  //         docs/data-layer.md §C2, §C6, §6.
  //
  // WHY A SECOND ENTRY POINT. `onTick`'s unit of work is a
  // `shared_ptr<rapidjson::Document>`: it walks `MemberBegin()..MemberEnd()`
  // constructing a `std::string` per member per tick for the raw-admission
  // ledger, and every `IEventComputer` then probes it by name. For a chart
  // tick that is irrelevant. At MBO rates — tens of millions of records per
  // symbol-day — it is the dominant cost, not the math
  // (docs/data-layer.md §C6). A `data::TickRecord` arrives with its fields
  // already resolved, so this path constructs no DOM and no per-field string.
  //
  // THE JSON PATH IS UNCHANGED AND STAYS. The legacy TCP feed server and
  // `market.wsclient` ingress keep using `onTick`. Two ingress shapes is a
  // cost; folding them is a bigger one (docs/data-layer.md §C2).
  //
  // A GRAPH CANNOT TELL WHICH ENTRY POINT FED IT, and that is structural
  // rather than asserted: both entry points are three-line adapters over one
  // private `ingest()` taking a `const engine::FieldSource&`, so the
  // raw-admission ledger, the history buffers, `computeAndStoreAtomics`, the
  // `AtomicStore` keys, the computer sets and `deliver()`'s ordering are one
  // implementation reached two ways (SPEC D1). Pinned by
  // tests/dispatch/RecordIngressParityTest.cpp, which drives one logical tick
  // down both paths and compares deliveries IN ORDER and store contents.
  //
  // THE SYMBOL IS STILL HEAP-COPIED HERE, deliberately. `StreamValue` carries
  // `std::string symbol`, so this method resolves `header.symbolId` back to a
  // ticker through `setSymbolTable()`'s table — one `std::string` per record,
  // plus `StreamValue`'s own copy per delivered value. ENC-1481's interning
  // removed the copy on the INGRESS side only. Removing it from the value path
  // is step 4 of ENC-1487's five-step benchmark ("interned symbols") and must
  // stay separately measurable, so it is NOT done here: doing it now would
  // merge two data points and misattribute B2.
  //
  // THERE IS NO EVENT TIME ON THIS PATH. `header.tsEventNs` is not exposed as
  // a field and the clock nodes are untouched — SPEC D9 /
  // docs/data-layer.md §C1, explicitly post-measurement. B1/B2 use a
  // non-windowed graph precisely so they need none of it. See
  // include/gma/engine/RecordFieldSource.hpp for the full field mapping and
  // for what each omission is protecting.
  //
  // PRECONDITIONS. `setSymbolTable()` must have been called with a table that
  // knows `rec.header.symbolId`; otherwise this is a no-op (there is no stream
  // key to route on, and routing under "" would be wrong rather than
  // degraded). Single-threaded ingress is a precondition here for exactly the
  // reason it is on `onTick` — see that method's ORDERED DELIVERY note.

  // reaches — `Event::type` defaults to "tick" and `MarketConnector`
  // registers its computer factory under "tick". Deliberately NOT

  // ATOMIC-KEY CONTRACT (ENC-792/M9, amended by ENC-1008).
  //
  // The stored key shape is a CLIENT-VISIBLE string, not an internal detail:
  // `field` in a WS subscribe request is read straight out of the request JSON
  // by TreeBuilder for both `Listener` and `AtomicAccessor` (TreeBuilder.cpp
  // ~257 and ~480), and AtomicAccessor resolves it against this store. There is
  // no version negotiation on it. That is why the shape is switchable by config
  // rather than simply changed.
  //
  // OFF — `cfg.atomicKeyNamespaceByField == false` (the default, and the
  // pre-ENC-1008 behaviour): builtin atomics live in a FLAT per-symbol namespace
  // keyed by bare function name (mean, sum, stddev, …) — the same key shape
  // Listeners bind to, AtomicAccessor reads, and MarketTA writes. `field` is not
  // folded into the key: a symbol is ASSUMED to have a single primary value
  // field driving its builtins. When that assumption does not hold — two fields
  // of one symbol both driving `mean` — they share the one key and the last
  // field written wins, silently losing the other. That is the ENC-1008 defect.
  //
  // ON — `cfg.atomicKeyNamespaceByField == true`: the stored key is
  // `<field>.<fn>` (`price.mean`, `size.mean`), so each source field keeps its
  // own derived values and neither is lost.
  //
  // What flipping it changes, exactly:
  //   * AtomicStore keys for DERIVED builtins move from `<fn>` to `<field>.<fn>`.
  //     This is the breaking half, and the reason the default is OFF. It has
  //     two shapes, and the second is nastier:
  //       - For the 53 builtin names nothing else writes, an `AtomicAccessor`
  //         bound to the bare name stops resolving — a loud failure.
  //       - For `mean`, `median` and `spread`, which MarketTickComputer ALSO
  //         writes (over price history, MarketTA.cpp ~91-92 and ~391), the bare
  //         key keeps resolving and silently returns MarketTA's value instead
  //         of the Dispatcher's. Today the Dispatcher wins the key by running
  //         after the computers; with the flag on it vacates it. That also
  //         splits push from pull for those three names — a Listener on bare
  //         `mean` still gets the Dispatcher's per-field mean while an
  //         AtomicAccessor on bare `mean` now reads MarketTA's price mean.
  //         Pinned by AtomicKeyNamespaceTest
  //         .MarketTAKeepsTheBareKeyAliveWithADifferentValue.
  //   * Listener PUSH is unchanged. Subscribers on the bare `<fn>` still receive
  //     every value exactly as before; `<field>.<fn>` becomes ADDITIONALLY
  //     subscribable. So the WS streaming surface is identical in both states.
  //   * Only builtins written by THIS function move. Connector-written atomics
  //     (MarketTA's bare `lastPrice`/`sma_5`/…, `ob.*`) and the ENC-1007 raw
  //     injected fields are untouched in both states.
  //   * More distinct store keys per symbol, so `maxFieldsPerSymbol` /
  //     AtomicStore::setCaps budgets are consumed faster. The failure mode is a
  //     silent drop: past the cap AtomicStore::set discards NEW keys, so
  //     flipping this can stop some OTHER producer's key being admitted.
  //   * The key is a plain `field + "." + fn` concatenation, so a field named
  //     after an existing dotted key prefix can collide with it: a field `ob`
  //     driving the builtin `spread` writes `ob.spread` (ob::Provider's key),
  //     and a field `synthetic` driving `sin` writes `synthetic.sin`
  //     (SyntheticConnector's). Narrow, opt-in-only, documented in
  //     docs/atomic-keys.md.
